                    We're a small group of tea fanatics from all over the world who bonded over our obsession. While we don't always agree on what smells the best, looks the most clear, or even how to make our tea, we all agree on one thing: tea of bad quality just isn't as enjoyable. Someone might look at Tea for Thee and wonder why we only have a small selection, and that is why. Every season we curate teas from around the world and decide what we would feel proud to serve the people most important to us, and then we share it with you. To us, you are more than just a customer. To us, you are a friend who deserves something a little different, a little harder to find, but a lot more delicious, a lot more enjoyable than the average boxed tea.
